**Key learning objectives:**

-   Privilege escalation techniques
-   Exploitation of integer vulnerabilities
-   Exploitation of kernel heap and stack vulnerabilities
-   Reliable exploitation of use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities on SMP systems
-   SMEP/SMAP/KPTI bypasses

**Course agenda:**

-   Introduction to Linux kernel exploits
-   Kernel debugging
-   GDB scripting engine and developing helper scripts
-   Dynamic debugging with kprobes / jprobes
-   Privilege escalation techniques
-   Read/write (controlled, partially-controlled and uncontrolled) primitives and ret2usr attacks
-   Architecture-specific exploitation techniques
-   Fixating the system and recovering the kernel state
-   Information leaks (environment and code-based)
-   Out of bounds (OOB) access vulnerabilities
-   Integer vulnerabilities (signedness, typecasting, overflows)
-   Kernel stack overflows
-   Dynamic memory management/SLAB allocator
-   Heap vulnerabilities (heap overflows, UAF, off-by-X)
-   Reliable UAF exploitation on SMP systems
-   Supervisor Mode Execution Protection / Access Protection / Kernel Page Table Isolation bypasses
-   Current UAF exploitation countermeasures and bypasses
-   Kernel race conditions
-   Universal heap sprays
-   Latest kernel exploitation mitigations
