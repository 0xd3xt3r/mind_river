There are may reason for not fixing a bug.
1. The bug has been under-rated and hence it not considered to be that important to be fixed and propagated everywhere.
2. The bug propagation itself is very costly process where the developer has to manually fix apply the patch and do the testing of this code. The burdensome part of this process is because we don't have good test-suite to automatically test new changes and hence manual intervention is required.
