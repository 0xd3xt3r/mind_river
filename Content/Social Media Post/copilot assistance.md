It was a pretty interesting weekend. I saw email on Friday morning the Github copilot is not free with limitation. I was thrilled to try out on some side project on weekend as I can't use it on my corporate network.

As you all might now it already there are my alternative for code completion but I never tried it as I was sceptical to share my private code on other platform but and I always wanted to try out copilot and this was the right movement I got access and also I was working on some open-source project so I thought I should give it a try.

I must say, I am IMPRESSED. The code completion although its not that accurate and it save me lot of typing.
