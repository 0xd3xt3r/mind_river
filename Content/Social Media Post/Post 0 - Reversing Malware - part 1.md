## Post #0 - Reversing Malware - part 1

I was once playing around reverse engineering side project, I stumbled upon a valuable technique called as Partial Binary Emulation while dissecting the Mirai IoT Botnet. This malicious software utilized a custom algorithm to obfuscate both its configuration and all strings within it. As the malware executed, it dynamically decrypted these strings through a specific function.  
  
As I delved deeper into the project, a thought crossed my mind: Could I decode all the obscured strings without having to run the malware itself? Was it possible to isolate and run only the de-obfuscation segment of the binary on all the strings it contained?  
  
Fortunately, I was in the process of familiarizing myself with a new reverse engineering tool, recommended by a friend, called radare2. What particularly piqued my interest was its fascinating feature known as binary emulation. I decided to put this feature to the test on the aforementioned binary.  
I meticulously documented my project and outlined the process of performing partial binary emulation with radare2, successfully decrypting all of its concealed scripting features.  
  
It was a long project, so I split it into three part blogpost
