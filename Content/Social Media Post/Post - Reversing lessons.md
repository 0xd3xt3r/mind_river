I have been doing reverse engineering for quite while some of the lesson which I learned along the way:

There three key techniques which I come back to time an again.

1. Writing lot of code - this mental gymnastic will help you to think like a developer.
2. Reading a log of code - you can't write all the possible combination of code out there, better to borrow the knowledge then to re-invent it yourself.
3. Thinking like a developer - how would you have debugged this crash?
4. Reverse engineering in more broader term - its not just about disassembling a binary. I more about understanding the design of components.

As the system gets complicated, so does debugging! 

How could you trace a bug the is triggered by events happening crossed code with is not even in the same machine!

It can get pretty wild!
