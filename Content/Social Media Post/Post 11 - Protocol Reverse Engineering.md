## Post #11 - Protocol Reverse Engineering

Reverse Engineering a Network Protocol for Profit and NO Fun!

Reverse engineering a binary is a hot topic of discussion, but protocol reversing hasn’t gained as much attention. Why, you might wonder? Well, it’s a whole different ball game. Just like binary reversing, protocol reversing demands significant manual effort and a great deal of patience-it's not something readily available in abundance.

The most common reason for reverse engineering a network protocol is when you need to add third-party support, but you lack access to the protocol’s documentation. Many commercial products rely on proprietary network protocols, and an undocumented protocol leaves you dependent on the format’s owner. Without a way to create a third-party library for processing network traffic or interacting with the program using a custom library, this limitation can be a significant inconvenience. For instance, it may hinder your ability to use competing software or write an antivirus signature for traffic if a malicious program utilizes that protocol.

I noticed this problem while involved in a project to Reverse Engineer a communication protocol for a proprietary product. During that time on the weekend I was also obsessed with Minetest game (a clone of Minecraft). One evening, while I was exploring the game, running around on the map searching for items to build my dream mansion, an idea struck me: what if I had a Python library to navigate the game world and find resources for me? That was my “Aaahhhaaa!” moment. I started Reversing the Protocol of this game and created a python library which connects with the Server and navigates the World programmatically. How convenient is that?

Much of the heavy lifting of the protocol data encoding/decoding was taken care by Scapy Framework which is specifically designed for this purpose. It's an open-source framework with quite a lot of following (10.5K github stars) and its a very matured framework since it has support for myriad of protocol which is not restricted to IP network but also for Bluetooth, Automotive and what-not. The magic lies in its modularity and extensibility.

When I was working on this project I noticed a stark difference in approach of reversing a Program Binary compared to reversing Network Protocol, I have to understand more about the Data Flow and focus on how to network packet is getting consumed by the program. It involves tracing data from low-level network APIs to higher software abstractions. Daunting? Absolutely. But the insights gained are worth every effort.

This led to exciting an adventures, which I’ve compiled into a training program "Reverse-Engineering and Fuzzing Custom Network Protocol". In this course, I guide you through the concepts of protocol reverse engineering. We’ll apply these principles to create a Python encoder/decoder that interacts with game servers as a bot player. Using this python script you can do lot of cool stuff in with the game which would otherwise require lots of manual effort.

Well, you might ask "What do I have to what all these?" if you happen to work with any sort of network protocol in you day to day work this training might be useful whether you are dealing with a malware traffic, propriety software, or vulnerability research(EternalBlue, wink wink!).
