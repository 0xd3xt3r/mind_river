## Post 18 : Blueteam Con Experience

Just wrapped up an incredible two days at Blueteam Con! It was a diverse crowd, from students grinding at the Resume Clinic and Job Fairs to security startups chasing their first customers, and established companies looking to expand their reach. I had some inspiring conversations with startups tackling challenges like log processing, Active Directory, pen-testing, and offensive security. It made me think, "What if I could do something like that?"

The ICS hacking village was a highlight, showing how attacks on industrial systems could disrupt everything from power grids to railwaysâ€”fascinating (and a bit scary!).

Heard some wild stories too:

1. A kid who gamed so much, Microsoft hired him to test their games. They saw so much potential that they sponsored his education and later hired him full-time!
2. An OSINT expert who _accidentally_ scanned military networks. Not only that, but he collected public WiFi data to track all the places the scanned devices had traveled. When attending conferences, he even scans all the public devices and does fascinating data analysis-check out the slides in the pics!
3. The creative (and alarming) ways attackers use legitimate services like GitHub, DocuSign, and Medium for phishing.
4. An intriguing talk on re-registering old malware domains to uncover dormant infections still lurking in corporate and personal networks.

Overall, a mind-blowing experience with lots of learning and inspiration!
