## Post #5 - Understanding Software Exploitation beyond Buffer Overflow

To truly understand the concept of Software Exploitation, it’s crucial to understand the process through which attackers identify bugs and leverage them to execute code, thereby gaining control over a victim’s device or PC. The skills needed to discover a bug and to exploit it are distinct, each demanding its own level of expertise. This discussion goes beyond the basics of Buffer Overflow, delving into various bug classes such as Use-After-Free, heap overflow, Race-condition bugs, Logic Bugs, and more. However, attempting to directly attack real-world software can be daunting due to the complexity of the code base and the intricacies of exploitation, which can lead to frustration.

In the process of bug discovery, we employ methods such as Static Analysis (utilizing tools like weggli, semgrep, etc.), fuzzing (with tools like AFL, Syzkaller, Peach Fuzzer, etc.), and code auditing (using Emacs, Eyes, and Brains). However, for the purpose of this discussion, let’s focus on the aspect of exploitation, and we can delve into the topic of bug discovery in a future conversation.

Binary exploitation is a challenging subject because to its steep learning curve. You need to have a deep understanding of various concepts such as Operating Systems, Assembly language, Memory models, and Bug classes. When I mention a steep curve, it implies that at one end of the curve, we have the classic buffer overflow (a topic extensively covered in numerous introductory tutorials), while midway through the curve, we encounter real-world targets like File Format parsing and media file parsers. As we ascend higher on the curve, we encounter more complex targets like Web Browsers, Operating System Kernels, and Hypervisors. Without a systematic approach to this subject, there’s a high likelihood of abandoning the journey midway.

Another challenge with modern day exploitation is that there are several exploit mitigation technique like ASLR, CFI, Stack canaries, DEP, etc. which makes exploitation harder and unreliable. But then there are technique to bypass those mitigation like ROP, leaking addresses, etc. which add to the complexities of exploitation. To bypass these techniques you need find multiple bugs and you need to chain these bugs in order to successfully exploit the targets.

Learning these techniques and bypasses in a systematic way can make the learning journey both enjoyable and less daunting. One such platform for learning and practicing these techniques is through CTFs (Capture The Flag) challenges/competitions. CTF platforms offer a range of challenges of varying complexities, from buffer overflow exploits to exploiting Web Browsers and OS Kernels. I have documented my journey of learning exploitation through CTF platforms like Pwnable (both pwnable.kr and pwnable.tw) on [my blog](https://www.taintedbits.com/categories/CTF-Writeups/).
