I have been doing reverse engineering for quite while some of the lesson which I learned along the way:

There three key techniques which I come back to time an again.

1. Writing a lot of code - While it may seem contrary to what we are do, i.e. understand what someone is written but, if you don't write a code how understand the design choices developer make then counting 

this mental gymnastic will help you to think like a developer.

3. Reading a lot of code - you can't write all the possible combination of code out there, better to borrow the knowledge then to re-invent it yourself.
4. Thinking like a developer - how would you have debugged this crash?

As the system gets complicated, so does debugging!
How could you trace a bug the is triggered by events happening crossed code with is not even in the same machine!

4. Reverse engineering in more broader term - its not just about disassembling a binary. I more about understanding the design of components.

It can get pretty wild!
