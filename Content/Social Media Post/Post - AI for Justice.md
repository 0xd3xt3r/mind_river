There so much discussion around people feeling threatened by AI taking out their jobs. 

The fear primarily steams from the fact that AI computer have developed more advance capabilities, better decision and calculated decision making. Unmatched efficient, high available. 

Common people what work hard feel threatened by this and they are expecting the government to step-in and resolve this problem.

But I have a different take on this issue! Do you know who is the most important entity which need to fear because of new AI capabilities? Its the government themselves.

They are the most inefficient and slowing moving part of our society.

This is not valid only in Indian context base but this efficiency can be seen in  government of different countries except for view outliers.

Government bodies not only suffer from in-efficiency but also from basic toward their own tribes/race/ethnicity which is question of in-justice.

Justice requires impartial and objective view of the situation to resolve a particular situation. Often people sitting on the place of doing justice suffer from bias had AI been doing that we can have much higher standard of objective judgements.

Disclaimer : this is just a thought experiment, I will always support the government in power, even if they change every quarter.
