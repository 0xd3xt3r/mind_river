## Abstract

Shaman is a platform-independent Dynamic Binary Analysis Framework designed to instrument programs without needing to recompile them or access their source code. It currently supports Linux (x86_64, ARM, ARM64) and Android (ARM64).

Think of it as a high-performance, scriptable debugger that can pause a program at any point to inspect or modify its memory and registers. This functionality enables tasks like tracing or altering System Call parameter, Injecting System calls, Collecting binary code-coverage, and intercepting or modifying function parameters.

The framework aims to simplify writing plugins and make it fast and easy to support new platforms, such as RISC-V, Power PC, MIPS, etc.

## Feature Pipeline

1. **Module Loading Event** - when ever there is a library been loaded you should get an event callback.
2. **Process Events** - in Resource Tracing features
3. **Signal/Exception handling callback**
4. **Loading library in the Tracee process** - this can be used load library in the tracee process and used to hook the function if needed.
5. **Instrumentation API** - as described in scorpio framework.
6. **Function Tracing API** - hooking function entry point and exit point to intercept parameter and return value just like system call tracing.
7. Implement GDB Remote protocol

## Challenges

1. Fetching children event is not consistent across Linux kernel version.

```bash
/**
* It is possible that this PID is not under our management,
* so now we have to check if any of our tracees have an
* event for us. We are no longer going to receieve signal from
* the `waitid()` as that may infinitely give us the same PID.
* However, the PID that it is reporting could be a child from
* a `fork()` event from one of our debuggees, and to get that
* `fork()` event we have to "look ahead" in the signal queue
* by non-blocking checking for signals from all of our
* tracees.
*
* This is designed for the very real case as such:
*
* signal_queue = [
*    STOP event from new child,
*    TRAP event from tracee telling us it forked the child,
* ]
*
* If we do not do this look ahead, the debugger will just
* infinitely loop on `waitid()` and never observe a PID
* under our control.
*
* It is also possible that we got a spurious `waitid()`
* indicating the PID of _another_ [`Debugger`] instance had
* an event. In this case, none of our tracees will have a
* signal, and we'll just go back to `waitid()` without doing
* anything. There's non-zero overhead to this, but I don't
* think there is any other way to implement this without pidfd
* which we are not using as it is too modern of a feature for
* the targets we want to support.

## Research Papers

1. [An In-Depth Analysis of Disassembly on Full-Scale x86/x64 Binaries](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_andriesse.pdf)
2. ARMore: pushing Love Back into binaries
	1. This paper focues on static rewriting of ARM binaries
	1. It can do this for PIC and non-PIC code with/out symbols
3. [SaBRe: load-time selective binary rewriting](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10009-021-00644-w.pdf?pdf=button)
	1. SaBRe rewrites specific constructs - particularly system calls and functions - when the program is loaded into memory, and intercepts them using plugins through a simple API.
	1. We also discuss the theoretical underpinnings of disassembling and rewriting.
	1. We developed two backends - for x86_64 and RISC-V - which were used to implement three plugins: a fast system call tracer, a multi-version executor, and a fault injector.
	1. Our evaluation shows that SaBRe imposes little overhead, typically below 3%.
4. [Non-stop Multi-threaded Debugging in GDB](https://s3.amazonaws.com/arena-attachments/309033/6f46f21a0abfe4de8f56468953378dfb.pdf)
  1. This paper accurately describes the challenges of breakpoint management in muli-threading environment. we have to implement these feature as gdb has implemented it.
