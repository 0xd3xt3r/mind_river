1. Who are your customer?
	1. Pentester - we will improve their productivity and their efficiency
		1. Typically they have about a 3 - 4 weeks in which they have to wrap-up their projects which is not enough time to do into the depth of the project.
2. What do we provide?
	1. Typical emulation take too much time to do the product research.
	2. Have a hardware is very accurate. So, if a bugs or crash is triggered you are pretty sure its not false-positive because you made some wrong assumption in your emulation design.
	3. 

3. Output
	1. Attack surface
		1. Port and associated process
		2. External network connection.
	2. Binary Code Coverage
		1. Basic Block
		2. Function Coverage.
		3. Per Module basis.
		4. Execution Trace

## Assumptions

3. You have device shell access and have ability to do debugging on the target.
4. If you are using full-system emulator you can still use this tool in emulator.
5. Linux base system (at the moment).
6. Vendor often have access to device shell white-box or gray-box based approach. 
7. To use this tool you have to install the binary in the target device we call this as an agent. This agent will connect with external program which the security analyst will use to do device recon and other Security Assessment.
8. This tool works in complete binary environment and you need source code. If you do have source code that will be an added advantage.

## How to interview the Customers

1. What does their day to day work looks like?
2. What are the metric they use to understand the successful delivery or the project?
3. Y Combi Questions
	1. Tell me how you do "IoT Assessment" today?
	2. What is the hardest thing about doing "IoT Assessment"?
	3. Why is it hard?
	4. How often do you have to do "IoT Assessment"?
	5. Why is it important for your company to do "x"?
	6. Why do you do to solve this problem for youself?
		1. Do you have a process/tool?
			1. what is the good thing about that tool?
			2. what could be better?
	7. Some follow-up questions?
		1. what do you mean by that?
		2. can you tell me more about that?
		3. Why is that important to you?
4. Some Tips:
	1. Focus on their Problems.
	2. Don't talk about your product or solution.
	3. User often don't have a good idea about what the good solution might be!

## User Research Invitation

Hi User,

My name is Hussain and I work at Qualcomm as Vulnerability Research where I as tasked to find vulnerability in our products.

Firstly, I'm extremely impressed with what you and your team have accomplished at Jio - congrats!
I'm in the process of starting a new company and as part of that process I'm researching and interviewing CEO's founders and IoT Pentesters how they think about security about the products about their company.
I would love to get a short phone call to learn how you are thinking about it. I understand you must be a very busy and I'm extremely thanful to even get a few minutes with you.
Let me know when is a good time and I'll send a calendar invite.
Many thanks,
