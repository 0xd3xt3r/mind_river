> **summary**:: Meeting by Alex Dent on how to write monthly Report

## Agenda

How to write monthly report.

## Notes and Decisions

**Purpose**

There are two main reasons why the monthly report exists:

1.  To give information to management to allow them to see blocking issues, link people together, and change the direction of the project if it’s not appropriate.
2.  To ensure that you keep a long-term focus on important projects without being distracted by the urgent projects or even in the people who are shouting the loudest.

**Audience**

While the monthly report does go out to a wide audience and we know that it’s read by people outside of QPSI, the main audience is your management chain up to [[Alex Gantman]].

**On the description paragraph**

-   Always write as if the reader doesn’t know anything about your project and hasn’t read your previous updates. Or possible know anything about security. And is a bit stupid.

**On the update paragraph**

- The aim of any report is to provide information and conclusions to the reader. Always tell the reader what to think (and provide enough data to allow them to investigate further if they’re interested).
- Data without context or an explicit conclusions is largely a waste of space. Ideally I want to see conclusions and data, but if I can only see one, then it’s definitely conclusions.
- If you claimed you were going to do something in last month’s report, then always explain the conclusion in this month’s report. Don’t assume that the reader hasn’t read your previous reports.

**For stylistic points**

- Don’t say **we expect [something]** or **we hope [something]**. Always say **we will [something]**. If you need to qualify it based on external events, then say what they are.
- Don’t overuse acronyms. Only use them when they really save space and when the acronym really adds value to the paragraph (e.g. going to used very often and is properly introduced).
- Don’t use HW and SW as acronyms. It drives me crazy.

## Action Items

Write good reports
