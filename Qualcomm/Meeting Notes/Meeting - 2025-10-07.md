- Since we can load a custom driver and we have shell access, it defeats the purpose of have a kernel integrity. 
- Attack surface of the product is different from Android which has a huge user-space attack surface.
- IoT camera IPs is mid-tier chipset for which we haven't written any grammar, since we only prioritize premium tier chipsets.
