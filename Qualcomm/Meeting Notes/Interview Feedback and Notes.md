## 01-07-2024

**Candidate** : Divyanjali
**Verdict** : NO
She doesn’t have any prior security related experience and much of her work is very theoretical in nature.

### Topics

- [x] Exploitation NO
- [x] Code Review - NO
- [x] Fuzzing - NO
- [x] Reversing - NO

### Notes
1. Her experience is more inclined towards software verification not towards software security
2. She has worked on LLVM pass and comfortable with C++.
3. She is not prior security experience and not familiar with Bug class and software exploitation

**Candidate** : Rathnakar Madhukar Yerraguntla.
**Verdict** : May Be
	1.	For fuzzing and bug hunting by code review – NO
	2.	Static analysis to improve Ozymandis or for CPU fuzzing for hexagon, YES.

### Topics

- [x] Exploitation - NO
- [x] Code Review - NO
- [x] Fuzzing - NO
- [x] Reversing - NO
- [x] CTF - NO

### Notes

- Compiler guy with design and verification background
- hardware background and currently working on EDA 
- maintain framework random valid assembly
- secure information flow partition 
1.	There are two project which he did caught my attention
	1.	Feature in programming language implemented using Static analysis to make sure the sensitive data is never leaked atleast by logic bug. Its implement in programming language which doesn’t have pointers.
	1.	Generating random snippets of assembly instruction snippets to verify CPU Bugs. Here bugs could also be functional not limited to security issues.
		1.	I think this kind of project can be useful for our Hexagon architecture
2.	Not very familiar with Bug Classes like overflow and stuff.
3.	Didn’t do any CTF challenges(not a negative pointer but show that doesn’t have much experience with software exploitation )
4.	Comfortable with Haskel, C++ and to some extend python
5.	I asked him “what is your Ideal working environment”
	1.	Answer small research team
