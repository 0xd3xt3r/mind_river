summary: Goal planning for 2025
---

## Goals

1. Windows Kernel Driver Fuzzing
	1. Will continue the effort of Fuzzing IOCTL Interface.
	2. Threat Modelling and attack surface. (Analytical Skills)
	3. Enumerating fuzzable drivers
2. Linux Kernel Driver Fuzzing
	1. Camera Driver fuzzing
	2. Integrate the Fuzzing effort with Camera APT Team. (Building Trusting Relationships)
3. Integrate and implement Syz-describe Paper for Linux kernel Attack surface monitoring
	1. (Creating the New and Different)
4. Internal Training (Communication)
	1. Do more Training through out the year
	2. One training is already done.
	3. Identify other team where training is needed or can be given.
5. On Target Firmware Fuzzing (Technical Knowledge)
	1. This is Long term Research Goal
	2. This will help us to fuzz Hypervisor firmware and other firmware.
	3. This will be mostly planning and small PoC.
6. Fuzzing Process Documentation - done (Communication)
7. Variant Analysis - find the patterns in the bugs and 
	1. GAP Analysis
	2. Root Cause Analysis
