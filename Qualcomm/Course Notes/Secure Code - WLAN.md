# Secure Code - WLAN

[Course Link](https://learning.qualcomm.com/enrol/index.php?id=24421)

## Introduction

In order to reduce the number of externally reported incidents in the WLAN code base, QPSI hosted the WifiSec campaign earlier this year. As a result of this campaign, QPSI has put together a new training course focused on common vulnerability patterns present throughout the WLAN stack. The intention of this course is to teach developers about common problems in WLAN so they can identify these issues before they are released. This course will be required for all WLAN developers in the future in order to check in code.
