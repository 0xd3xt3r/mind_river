## Methodology

For the reverse engineering process we implemented the following steps to allow us to perform both static and dynamic analysis of Exchange and its security patches:

- **Diff:** review differences between vulnerable version and patched version
- **Test:** deploy a full test environment of the vulnerable version
- **Observe:** instrument deployment to gain knowledge of typical network communication
- **Investigate:** iterate over each CVE, connect patch diff to network traffic, and fabricate proof-of-concept exploits
