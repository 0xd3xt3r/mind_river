# Exploiting Javascript V8 Engine

## Object Representation

The understanding of the object in rep in memory is important because it helps you to create exploit primitives. How the data is created and maintained on the heap.
Mechanism of Object creation is a very important concept from a primitive crafting perspective.

## Important Concept for exploitation

1. Pointer compression - How a 64-bit address is represented with 32 bit address.
2. Function [side-effects](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8129105/javascript-closures-and-side-effects-in-plain-english-separately) . Opposite of function with side-effect is pure function. This is a functional programming concept.
