## Exploitation Techniques 

## Read Primitive 

1.  Library base address recovery using leak memory address and offset subtraction. As offsets are fixed from base address. 
2.  Unsorted/Small bins heap memory leak. 
3.  GOT table leak to leak Libc base address. 
4.  Stack memory leak by leaking environ variable from Libc. 
5.  overwrite GOT table function whose parameter which we control fully to overwrite it with printf function and do format string to leak data from stack. 
6.  For heap exploitation singly linked list are good for leaking heap address space and double can be used to leak libc and heap. 

## Write Primitive 

1.  Putting mis-aligned fake chunk address in fastbin list [src](https://uaf.io/exploitation/2017/03/19/0ctf-Quals-2017-BabyHeap2017.html). This is mitigated in glibc 2.23 and late not sure please double check. 
2.  The fastbin / tcache bin singly list pointer manipulation by use-after-free.     
3.  Doubly linked list can be used to do arbitrary write on remote the element operation. 


## Execution Primitive 

1.  GOT Table overwrite to get execution i.e overwrite free with system function 
2.  ONE GADGET tool 
3.  ROP and stack pivot ROP

## Vulnerability Discovery
1.  Vulnerability searching can be accelerate by using fuzzing methods 
2.  we can use tools radamsa and AFL++
