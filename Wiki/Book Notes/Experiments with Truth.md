## Notes
**On Truth & God**

- [[Morality]] is the basis of things and [[truth]] is the substance of all morality.
- I worship [[God]] as [[Truth]] only.
- There are innumerable definitions of [[God]] because His manifestations are innumerable.
- The truth is the sovereign principle, which includes numerous other principles. This truth is not only truthfulness in word but also in thoughts, and not only the relative truth of our conception, but the absolute truth, the Eternal Principle, that is God. 

**On Education**
- Bad [[handwriting]] should be regarded as a sign of an imperfect education. Children should be first taught the art of drawing before learning how to write.
- All Indian curricula of higher education there should be a place for Hindi, Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic and English, besides of course the vernacular.  A scientific knowledge of one language make a knowledge of other languages comparatively easy.

**On Friendship**
- A reformer cannot afford to have close intimacy with him who he seeks to reform. True [friendship] is an identity of souls rarely to be found in this world. Only between like natures can friendship be altogether worthy and enduring. Friends react on one another. Hence in friendship there is very little scope for reform.
- All exclusive intimacies are to be avoided; for man takes in vice far more readily than virtue. And he who would be friends with God must remain alone or make the whole world his friend.

**Diet**

- Ethically, man's supremacy over the lower animals meant not that former should prey upon the latter, but that higher should protect the lower, that there should be mutual aid between the two as between man and man.

**On Silence**

- [[Silence]] is part of the spiritual discipline of a votary of truth. Proneness to exaggerate, to suppress or modify the truth, wittingly or unwittingly is a natural weakness of man and silence is necessary in order to surmount it.
- A man of few words will rarely be thoughtless in his [[speech]]; he will measure every word.

**On Religion**

- Who that has prided himself on his spiritual strength has not seen it humbled to dust? A knowledge of religion, as distinguished from experience, seems but chaff is such moments of trials. 

**On Guru**
- There is a great deal of truth in the doctrine that true knowledge is impossible without a [[Guru]]. An imperfect teacher may be tolerable in mundane matters, but no in spiritual matters. Only a perfect *gnani* deserves to be enthroned as Guru.
- For one gets the Guru that one deserves.

**On Humility**
- It has always been a mystery to me how men can feel themselves honored by the humiliation of their fellow-beings.

**On Service**

- Service has no meaning unless one takes pleasure in it. When it is done for show or for fear of public opinion, it stunts the man and crushes his spirit. Service which is rendered without joy helps neither the servant nor the served. 
- All other pleasure and possessions pale into nothingness before service which is rendered in a spirit of joy

**Misc**

- I do not seek redemption from the consequence of my sin. I seek to be redeemed from sin itself, or rather from the very thought of sin. Until I have attained that end, I shall be content to be restless.
- Its was not as easy to commit suicide as to contemplate it . And since then, whenever I have heard of someone threatening to commit suicide, it has had little or no effect on me.
- Service without humility is selfishness and egotism.

**Books that has left a deep impression on me(Ghandi)**
1. The Kingdom of God is within You - Tolstoy
2. Unto this Last - Ruskin

- Bagwat Gita
	> If one Ponders on objects of the sense, there springs [[Attraction]]; from attraction grows [[desire]], Desire flames to fierce [[passion]], passion breeds Recklessness; then the [[memory]] -
	> all betrayed- Lets noble purpose go, and saps the mind,
	> Till purpose, mind, and man are all Undone.
