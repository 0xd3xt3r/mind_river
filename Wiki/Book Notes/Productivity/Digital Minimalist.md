## Principles of Digital Minimalism

### Principle #1 - Clutter is Costly

Cluttering your time and attention with too many devices, apps and services creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each individual item provides in isolation.

This principle of minimalism is best explained by **Thoreau** minimal life style experiment.

1. _I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived._
2. He argues that “_The cost of thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run”._ The ultimate price of the things to buy is spend out of your life.
3. _Mass of men lead lives of quite desperation._ Putting extra efforts just so that they can earn extra money which a stressful mortgage and maintaining all the stuff you have bought with that extra money.
4. _I see young men whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, house, barns, cattle, and farming tools, for they are easily acquired than got rid of._

The cost of things in your life are **time and attention ****which produces more stress, anxiety, chaotic, disorganized, and distracts you for meaningful work. The cumulative cost of the non-crucial things we clutter our lives with can far outweigh the small benefits each individual piece of the clutter promises.

Carefully weight the balance the cost of the new benefit of the technology with the time and attention the tool demands. For example social media presence might bring some small benefits but at large it very distracting and cognitive demanding.

### Principle #2 - Optimization is important

Deciding a particular technology supports something you value is only that first step. To truly extract is full potential benefits, it’s necessary to think carefully about how will you use the technology.

This principle is best described with _The law of diminishing returns_ in economics. Investing indefinitely in a process/things cannot give you proportional return indefinitely.

### Principle #3 - Intentionality is satisfying

Digital minimalists derive significant satisfaction from their general commitment to begin more intentional about how they engage with new technologies. This source of satisfaction is independent of the specifics decisions they make and is one of the biggest reasons that minimalism tends to be immensely meaningful to its practitioners.

## The Digital Detox Experiment

In the experiment we will take 30 day break from non-crucial apps, sites, games, tools and streaming services used via mobile, computer.

### Step #1: Define the technology rules

1. Define the technologies which are not crucial for you daily life like apps, website, streaming services etc. And band them for the duration of this experiment.
2. There might be some service which might be crucial for your daily work like email, not using them might cause harm to personal and professional life don’t ban these apps/services.
3. There might be certain technology which are largely non-crucial but with exception of few critical cases for such technologies define **standard operating procedure**.
4. Too many operating procedure might put the exercise in jeopardy so try to make the whole above thing simple as possible.

### Step #2: Take the Break

1. Initially when you take the break you won’t feel comfortable with the new environment without distraction but this will only last for only one or two weeks.
2. The goal of this experiment is to discover higher-quality activities and leisure that you can fill with the time left vacant by these optional technology.
3. This time also can also be taken to understand what’s more important to you and what you enjoy the world outside the glowing screen.

### Step #3: Reintroduce the technology

In this step you reintroduce technology which you think is useful very cautiously.

# Practice the Minimalism

### Spend Time Alone
