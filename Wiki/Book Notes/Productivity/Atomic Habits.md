This book is about understanding Habits and creating new habits.

The principle of the aggregation of [[Marginal Improvement]] is similar to concept of compounding effect.

A small changes made to particular thing can have very huge improvement over long period of time

The principle states that if you break down everything thing that goes into forming a [[complex skill]], and then improve the individual components by 1% and then when you put it back together you will give a significant improvement in the overall skill.

The author give a example of performance coach of British cyclist team how applies this principle gets remarkable results over the span of 10 years from 2007-17.

## Why forming habits is difficult?

Habits are compound interest of [[self-improvement]]. A daily small change to good or bad habit and have a striking result. One example will be you own smoking habit which has persisted over the years and now it has become impossible to get rid of.

The reason we don't see point in improving small daily habits is that i doesn't produce effect which are visible immediately. So we may allow an excuse of small bad habit daily thinking it will not happen again or its just once but it never stops.

## Some Daily Habits I have

### Good habits

1. Running - but this is not regular

### Bad Habits

1. Smoking
2. Slacking on Phone
3. Watching movie before sleep
4. Slacking on web during office hours

### Some good habits I want to cultivate

1. Reading
2. Writing
3. Exercise
4. Leaning new thing and building a [[Personal Knowledge Management]](PKM) system
5. Reflection in general to have better emotional stability.

> Habits are double edge sword the bad one can cut you down just as good as good one can bring you up.

Another approach is to setting up system is more fruitful then setting goals. Habit is about creating a system which has long-term benefits, rather then goal which binary emotion where you either successed or fail.

Setting goals and not having a proper system has couple of problem.
1. Goals are set by winners and losers, so what the difference between two group ? their system.
2. Goals will give you momentary motivation to achieve something which may not last but setting up system will make you thrive in long term.
3. Once you achieve you goal you are no longer benefiting from the action which you took to achieve the goal. For example after people get their degree they abandon the idea of learning anything new.

Building good habits takes certain amount of time before you start see any results.


## Barriers to building Habits

There are three layer of building habits.

1. Goal - we decide what we want to achieve
2. Action - what action to we take achieve that goal
3. Identity - That habit is something that has become out identity

These layers are like onion rings with goal been the outer part.

When people try to change the habit they take outer to inner approach. While more effective approach is the talk inner to outer approach. Where you first change your identify about your action. For example if you are trying to quit smoking introduced yourself as *not a smoker* instead of I am trying to *quit smoking*.

A person is more likely to behave on something which is part of his identity. A Habit is going to stick with you if you make it part of your identity, because this builds a self image.

Some example would be:
1. The goal is not read 10 books but to become a reader(identity).
2. The goal is not run marathon but to become a runner(identity).
