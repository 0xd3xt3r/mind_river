## Notes

- A bullet point with checkbox can sent to other notes by including a hashtag.
- Then you can create a Topic page which will pull the logs on that pages with dataview query.
- You can then collect these topic page on the top level MoC Page.
- Data is captured as you go through out your day in Daily, weekly and monthly notes. And from there its pushed to different MoC Pages by means of page links and hashtags
- Don't shy away from creating too many file for small notes, they are consolidated based on hashtags and meta data
- Sprint is the effort which you have done for a project
- Use combination for hashtag and project link to capture sprint log or any other data
- Everything starts with Daily Notes use calendar to navigate
