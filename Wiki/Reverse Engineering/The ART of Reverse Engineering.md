# Master the ART Of Reverse Engineering

Tags : #reverse-engineering 

The goal of this project is to attain the mastery of the binary reverse engineering. The systematic approach to learn this skill set will be to first do reconnaissance of the field to figure out what all category of problem exist and the best method will be to start looking at [[CTF]] challenges. Start solving challenges make notes of the category of the problem and different technique which can be used to solve them. Some of the category I have see so far is.

## Category
1. Binary Reversing - Classic assembly code readying 
2. [[SMT solver]] - using SMT solver to find the input
3. Magic - figuring the solution by reversing few binaries and the automating the solution on big set of binaries.
4. Reversing non native code like Java, .Net, etc.
5. Binary code emulation like Unicorn 

How to collect dynamic tracing from [[DBI]] like [[Frida]] and feeding it to disassembly tools like [[Ghidra]] and [[IDA Pro]].
