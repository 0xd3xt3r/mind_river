## Thoughts & Reflections
1. All [[bad behaviors]] have root in short term thinking.
2. The reason I am avoiding working in [[Google]] is :
	1. I don't want to go to USA
	2. I don't want to work in JavaScript reversing and directly work on native malware stuff, which seems very narrow thinking.
		1. I don't want to start my all the learning process again for malware position
	3. I don't want to re-allocate too much.
	4. I don't want to learn algorithm programming.
