## Thoughts & Reflections

1. When you think of doing a good deed for the sake of Allah you cannot the evil you are facing you are doing it for Allah and for his happiness alone, nothing else in return should be expected. When facing the evil you will often be tempted to act like them unethical, immoral and evil itself.
