- [Phaser](phasar.org) - static taint analysis framework for C/C++
	- Data-flow analysis is a form of static analysis which works by propagating information about the property of interest—the data-flow facts—through a model of the program.
		- call strings and functional iterative
			- call-string approach which is limited to a certain level of context-sensitivity
		- Inter-procedural Finite Distributive Subset (IFDS)
		- Inter-procedural Distributive Environments (IDE)
		- IFDS and IDE are fully context-sensitive, i.e., k = ∞.
		- The reachability is computed using the so called exploded super-graph (ESG)
