## Thoughts & Reflections

1. Felt the urge of [[smoking]] and went on it. Feeling overwhelmed about the marriage.
2. When I start with the new note talking project with obsidian I again felt like i am slipping into [[perfectionism]]. Instead of building the notes and gradually transforming it into folder structure need which is a bottom-up approach. I did the same mistake of make the complicate folder structure and start putting notes into it.
