# An Educated Mind

> The danger of education as entertainment is that students will learn that learning should be a form of entertainment, and that anything worth learning can take the form of entertainment, and ought to. 
> *Book Anti-fragile*

> Imitate, Mutate


## [[Reading]]

 > It is the mark of **an educated mind** to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. - *Aristotle*

1. Reading help you gather tools/arsenal of expression, you can say it a a imitation, I would say it as coping, but who cares if it works. 
2. Helps you expand your horizon, gather ideas from different domains from people of different culture and idea and people who have different thought process 
3. Depends on what you read, reading a text that require lots of effort to produce is more valuable to spend your time and content that is produced. The medium is the message (The Medium is the Metaphor) 
4. More Good Guide can be found in the book [[How to Read a book]].

## [[Writing]]

1. Writing helps you think deeper, to get to the root of the matter. When you write you slowly create an argument and you will think that if someone reads this I don't want to look stupid maybe I should refine my argument or expression.     
2. It will help you do discover idea which were buried in your subconscious mind. Helps you unearth memories which were otherwise suppressed by other memories. 
3. You are talking to audience who is really interested to listen to or at least gives you a chance to present your argument as a whole. you have their undivided attention. 
4. Write Every Day but share only when you are ready.
5. Writing Note of the books I have read help me to remember the good ideas I can across when I was reading that book.

## [[Speaking]]
1. This is very important as in this complex world you will be challenged with your beliefs and thoughts. You might have to explain your thought or defend them and some case correct them for these to have you will have to communicate them effectively.
2. Speaking me look very much like write as both of them these methods are egress of our knowledge/thought which is different from reading which is ingression of knowledge. But we can say that writing is speaking to yourself in your mind. Speaking to other require different skillset like your voice how your sentence/words sound. Your voice encode information like your emotional state your confidence and you are steaming your thoughts in continues fashion buffer in the steam would imply less confidence. 
3. Body language
