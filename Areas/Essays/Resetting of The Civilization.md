Growing up I always watch my elders and my father watching political news in the evening which always bothered by with all the negativity. This left a distasteful in my mind about the word politics.

In my quest to understand philosophy I while i was ready about it, the author introduced me to the word politics and which goes something like this "Define politics from Wikipedia" and what my mind picked-up was "Organizing people/society such that we are able to maximize the people potential". This was very profound change from what I was introduce about the subject from my early life. Well after munching on this new definition, I thought, what if I completely misunderstood the this whole thing. Subsequently after few days, I was thinking if I were to introduce this topic completely in new light to someone(children) new to this world, how would I explain them this concept? So I designed this following thought experiment, which ask students series of questions and give them the floor to show their thought process.

This experiment could also introduce a positive mindset about politics, so if they when become a future politician they should a deep impact on their mind that politics is not about exploiting public resources and about utilizing those resources to maximize the potentials of the society and individual to create a society which is peaceful and safe.

Such thought experiment are topic of countless movies and tv series, some come in the form of travelling to space, deadly disease breakout or some lunatic genius super villain trying to create a weapon of mass destruction and will to survive only choose few, etc. Or a some climate disaster who only leave few people and they are tasked with recovery.

Lets say you have 50,000(this could be any reasonably large number) people in a completely new land which has cultivable land, a river flowing near by and a jungle. How would you go about organizing the people such that you are able to first, survive in the new environment. Next, start thriving.

You have to start organizing the people into group which can provide fundamental service which is food, shelter and cloth. Then you can go on how will you achieve food security, health service and water and sanitization facility. Then you go on to housing and finance. 

This is the thought experiment and in which the student has to as real much a possible.
