## Cognitive Exoskeleton 

The goal of this project is to understand the concept of second brain and how build and maintain an effective [[Personal Knowledge Management]]. We also need to look into how to organize the notes. Also the other goal is to periodically revisit those notes to create new connection between piece of knowledge to create new idea. 

> You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large, they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your 12 problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit and people will say “How did he do it. He must be a genius.”

## Personal Knowledge Management

PARA method is one of the technique used to organize notes. In this method notes are organized by following areas :

1. **Project** - the projects you are working on. These are time bound efforts.
2. **Area** - Continues area of commitment
3. **Resource** - Long term permanent knowledge
4. **Archive** - Everything else goes here. Habit routines and rituals.
