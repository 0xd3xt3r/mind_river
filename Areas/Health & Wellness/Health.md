## [[Running]]

1. 29-03-21 running 3 days in row leads to fatigue in the legs and its pain too much
2. So what we can do is walk and run alternate days.

### Goals
1. Run 5k
2. Run 10k
3. Run Half Marathon
4. Run Full Marathon

### Training Plan
1. [Halhigdon - Novice 10k Plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/base-training/novice-base-training/)
2. [Hanson Training Plan](https://www.runtothefinish.com/hanson-marathon-training-method-review/)

## [[Strength Training]] / [[Gym]]
Strength training or resistance training involves the performance of physical exercises that are designed to improve strength and endurance. It is often associated with the lifting of weights.

**Start Date** : 28-01-2022

### Push-Pull Routine
1. Push Workout - Chest, Shoulders & Triceps
	1. Chest
	2. Shoulders
	3. Triceps
2. Pull Workout - Back, Traps & Biceps
	1. Back
	2. Traps
	3. Biceps
3. Legs Workout - Quads, i & Calves
	1. Quads
	2. Hamstrings
	3. Calves

**Note** : this doesn't workout well for me as beginner. As my muscle recovery was not that good so following this routine twice a week was not optimal. and also the secondary muscle in the training saw little process compared to primary muscle.

### Routine 2
1. Chest & Triceps
2. Legs - Quads & Hamstrings
3. Back & Biceps
4. Arms - Biceps &Triceps
5. Shoulders
6. Chest / Cardio

**Note** : This workout give time to each muscle group to recover well.

### Notes
1. The limitation of push pull routine is that the muscle group which are trained later not much pressure is put on to them as they get exhausted by prior muscle like chest triceps by the time you complete chest triceps are already saturated. Trying different split.

### Riding Logs

#### 14-01-2021
- Ride Distance : 85 km
- Ride time : 4 hrs 30 min
- Total time : 6 hrs
- Nutrition
	- 5 liter water
	- 1 sugar cange juice
	- bowl full of milk, oats and peanut butter ( this helped me sustain till Aravalli trails)
	- in lunch had 1 veg sandwich and small bowl of mix Pulav
		- this was not sufficient and later part of ride caused fatigue because of this.
		- better to carry own lunch or plan proper ride
	- we need a better nutrition plan

#### 07-11-2021
- **Ride Distance** - 55 Km
- **Ride time** - 2 hr 30 mins
- Took 4 gm ORS Electral Powder with 1.5 liter water
- Consumed around 2.5 liters of water
- 4 small bananas
- 1 full Glass Sugar cane juice

#### 20-11-2021
- **Target Ride** : 80 KM
- This ride didn't successed as night before that I didn't sleep adequately and smoked lots of **Hukka**
- also I was not consistently ride. Because of this reason I was not able to have rhythm  in my body to ride.
- I ended up doing the 55 KM ride.
- Also had lots of vomiting when I was in the Palanpur.
- Whether conditions were also not good and its was raining heavily 2 days prior due to which on the day of the ride it was mildly humid and hot.

### Diet Plan

#### Before Cycling

#### During Cycling
- **Hydration** : 
	- On the bike, a good rule of thumb is to consume between 500 and 700 milligrams per hour, which is about how much you can absorb within that time.
		- ![[Pasted image 20211109144033.png]]
	- Start with that amount and see how you tolerate it. If you feel sluggish or dizzy, or experience muscle cramps, you may need to increase it.
	- If you develop stomach issues such as diarrhea, you may be taking in too much; salt draws water into your gut and can lead to the runs.
	- Foods
