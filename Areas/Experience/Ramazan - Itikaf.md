- The Itikaf was held at Shidpur eid-gaah for the period of 3 days which is the minimum mandatory period. It was organized by Shidpur Jamat and it was don't very well. 22 People participated out which 11 were from Shedrana. A big tent was created and in that there was small compartment for each person. Food arraignment was also done by the Jamat and it was done very well.
- My purpose was solely to complete Matausakteen but I could complete about 100 pages approx from 240 page to 340 and also I carried Dua-e-Kumail and Saif-e-kamela. But I didn't read any of the Dua because Dua-e-kumail was already read in group.
- Solitude of this kind helps you to clear my mind and help me to focus solely on Tafseer which I was carrying. Earlier I couldn't understand connection between Ayat but now thing make much sense. This isolation would be very difficult if I would have done all alone, as my own thoughts would have cased harm to me. But the company of Ayat made the time really blissful. I would like to do more of these session.
- On contemplating about the Surah I came know how Allah gave his reasoning about how Jews defied the orders of God and how Allah mentions them in Sura-e-Bakar.
