# Investment Strategy

What do you want?

1. Growth
2. Stability
3. Income
4. Simplicity
5. Liquidity

## Notes

- Investor should also keep in mind what he will do in extremely worse situation like 2008 crash when your portfolio is down by 50%. So been very aggressive investor should have a very good backup income for the bad times.
- Portfolio Management Services [[PMS]] and Alternate Investment Services are suited for people who want to invest minimum 5 cores or at best 10 cores otherwise stick with Mutual Fund etc. Basically suited for Hight Net-worth Individuals [[HNI]]. And you are going to invest this much amount when you have that much money in spare and you want to risk that much money.
- I had invested a lump sum in [[PPFAS]] [[Liquid Fund]], from which the money shifts to a flexi-cap fund through a STP. The entire money will be transferred in 30 [[instalments]]. However, I’m worried about the opportunity cost of not keeping money in the debt fund. Should I shift my funds to a conservative hybrid fund and then start an STP to a flexi-cap or should I let it be the way it is?
	- Conservative hybrid funds invest 10-25% in [[equity]] instruments. As per historical data, on a rolling returns basis this category has seen negative returns. The maturity profile of the debt component here may not remain constant and may not match your horizon. Also, these funds can venture into low credit instruments which can be risky. This category can face volatility and impact your STP amount. The minimum horizon for this category should be around 3-5 years.
	- Keeping these points in mind I would not suggest you shift your funds into this category. Since your STP time frame is short and your main goal is to invest in equities, opportunity cost on the debt side should not be your primary concern. 
	- On the other hand, since you have lumpsum money in a liquid fund you can think of deploying this corpus in decent correction pockets over the 30-month period and shorten your STP time frame. This way you will be able to generate higher returns from equities in the long run.
	- If you don’t know how and when to time the equity markets, you can stick with [[systematically investing]] in equities via STP route. 
	- Since we will see a rate hike cycle soon and it will impact the returns of many [[debt funds]], I suggest you stick with liquid, low duration and arbitrage funds. 
	- Out of your 30 monthly [[STP]] instalments you can leave the corpus for the initial 15 months in your liquid fund and the rest you can park in high credit quality low duration funds and arbitrage funds. Towards the end of your initial 15 monthly STP installment period you can redeem and invest back in your current liquid fund. This way you can get slightly higher returns than the liquid category. Please keep in mind the execution can be tricky. If you don’t understand and can’t manage this then staying put in your liquid fund will be more convenient and less risky.

## Strategies

> Investment are mostly the factor of investment amount principal, not 

1. Prof Pattu from [FreefinCal](http://freefincal.com)
	1. **Managing Risk** - The money which you have invested in the market is completely subjected to the full swing of the market.
		1. markets can go dormant for long periods of time like 4-5 years.
		2. if you need money in 2 years, you should withdraw it right now or put it in liquid/short duration funds.
	2. **Asset Allocation** - This is a type of risk management, where you are allocating portfolio which has equity and debt allocation such the I doesn't goes through a wild swing in bad market conditions.
	3. **Portfolio rebalancing** - decide what's your portfolio allocation like 70 - equity and 30 - debt, balance the portfolio once a year.
		1. Don't worry about the taxes in the long run assert allocation helps you to manage risk
	4. **Simplicity of investment** - no active fund consistently performs over long period of time.  
		1. Index Funds - this is algorithmically arrived formula which is based on market capitalization.  
			1. Nifty 50 - weighted by free float which give is a very good liquidity.
			2. Nifty Next 50 - very volatile but gives you midcap fund like return
			3. Midcap 150 - very diversified and less volatile compared to nifty 50
		2. Don't include small-cap as no active or passive fund is able to beat midcap index, so why not just invest in midcap instead.
		3. I have included only one active fund which is Parag Parikh because of its consistent returns. I have spread it with 50:50 with flexi and ELSS.
	5. **Goal based planning**
		1. Different portfolio for different goal for like child education, marriage, etc.
		2. Reduce the equity allocation closer to your goals.
