## How to writing a good Review

1. Write email to people you have worked with highlighting your work which you have done with them
2. Writing a good, concise, yet detailed self-review is essential to pitch yourself for a good appraisal, a bonus, and even a promotion. Here are some pointers I followed while I wrote my self-reviews  
	- I never wrote a self-review as a list of tasks completed  
	- I kept it focused more on quantified outcomes instead of output  
	- Instead of saying I completed tasks a, b, and c; I always mentioned that "In the last year, I increased the performance of xyz by 23% percent by doing a, b, and c". The quantified impact of the work is crucial.
3. I showcased leadership skills - autonomy and ownership  
	- Whenever possible I added pointers that showcased my leadership skills. In the above example, I always extended the pointer by saying "... by doing a, b, and c. While working on them I co-ordinated with teams p and q across timezones to ensure smooth and timely delivery".
4. I highlighted different initiatives I started
	- Instead of keeping self-review specific to task items I completed, I always mentioned a few pointers about the peripheral initiatives I took or started; for example, presented an org-wide tech talk, introduced a new process, etc.  
5. I always highlighted the challenges involved
	- Some tasks are more challenging than others and hence I made sure that I gave them their due and highlighted the hurdles and challenges I overcame while getting things done. A line or two helped me demonstrate my problem-solving skills and resilience.  
  
Self-review is an excellent opportunity to be your own advocate and it is important to put your best foot forward without sounding narcissistic.
